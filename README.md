#Pear-PHPUnit
An attempt to install phpunit via Composer, based on the PEAR package

## What is it?
The main idea is a bridge between Pear and Composer. If this works we can install PHPUnit (and other Pear packages) using Composer. In this way each project are responsible by your dependency avoiding a central Pear with a lot of packages useless.

## What now?
This project is in a very alpha stage. Don't use until a beta version be released.
